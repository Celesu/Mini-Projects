This is the first week case study from [8weeksqlchallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/), for a beginner and a solo learner like me, the task sure is hard, but when I keep trying to figure it out, I finally made it!

In "Case Study Query" it also contains the questions and their answers, as well as the query syntax to find the answer.
