This is my SQL project. I found the problems from [this website.](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) From the website, it helped me a lot to improve my SQL skills, starting with a basic query to join multiple tables, using CTE (common table expressions), a temporary table, and many more! Since I'm not joining their course (sorry, I can't afford it right now :sweat:), I'm figuring out how to finish the task myself.
