This is my SQL project. I found the problems from [this website.](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/) From the website, it helped me a lot to improve my SQL skills, start from doing basic query to join multiple tables, using CTE (common table expressions), temporary table, and many more! Since I'm not joining their course (sorry, I can't afford it right not :cry:), I'm figuring how to finish the task myself.
