This is the second week's case study from [8weeksqlchallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/), after doing the first week's case study, I realized there were so many things I could learn by doing the challenge, so I'm trying to finish the second week's case study too. The case study is much more complicated than the first one, and yeah, I need to think even harder to finish the task; some problems make me watch my laptop for hours before I finally finish it.

In "Case Study Query" it also contains the questions and their answers, as well as the query syntax to find the answer.
