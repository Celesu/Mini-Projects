This is a mini project that I got from [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/), by [IndosatOoredoo](https://idcamp.ioh.co.id/).

This the code that I made to fulfil my final submission of training in [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/). With using tensorflow, I managed to make a program to identify which image (hand, human hand image) that is a "rock" or "paper" or "scissor".
