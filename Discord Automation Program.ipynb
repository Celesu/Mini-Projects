If it's the message, then the cards that the bot just dropped (the bot will drop 3 cards) may contain a high wishlist (pog) card, so I'll take the chance to grab it. Since my server has a bot that will remind you if there's a pog card or not, I added a feature to notice the things too.\n",

I do this by using the time.sleep(x second) command. Is there a watermelon reaction being added to it by the bot or not? My program will be able to tell if the number of message reactions is four (or more than three), or just three. If there are four, then there's a watermelon on it, then my program will grabit for me.\n",
